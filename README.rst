Pew 2
-----
This is a rewrite of "Python Env Wrapper" by @berdario.
https://github.com/berdario/pew

It simplifies the script by using Armin Ronocher's Click
library for creating command line interfaces.


Enhancements
============

* More consistent help messages.
* Support for environment namespaces.

Planned Enhancements
====================

* Write test suite in Python using Click's testing tools.

Backward Incompatibilities
==========================

* The ``pew-subcommand`` form of invoking subcommands is removed.
